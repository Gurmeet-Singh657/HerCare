    question: `Has anyone been held accountable? Were there interventions from the police/authorities)?`,
    answer: `We focus on larger trends that are emerging in locations or by category. In several cases, on presenting the data, the police have taken action based on the reports we received. In Bandra, Mumbai there were several cases of chain-snatching which were informed to the police. Street lighting was improved and the beat patrol timings were changed. This resulted in an immediate decrease in the number of cases of chain-snatching.
          Similary, in Lal Kuan, Delhi, there were many cases of groping, assault and sexual harassment against women. As the public toilets were closed and locked, the women and girls would go to a nearby jungle area to relieve themselves. We approached the local MLA with reports and video footage by DNA India and accompanied by Plan India’s Gender Resource Coordinator. As a result, the toilets were unlocked and ensured that they were maintained well.`,

    question:
      "Why do you feel there needs to be an app to report the incidents?",
    answer: `People who harass do so in their own comfort zones. Silence on the part of victims and bystanders makes the perpetrators more confident and the harassment only increases from cases like staring and indecent gestures to stalking and assault. An informal reporting system is required to share such information that could be trivial to report to the police but useful to someone else. While there is a move to make the implementation of legislations more effective, the question we ask is – as ordinary citizens, what can we do to create change?`,

  {
    question: `Do I have to reveal my name and identity?`,
